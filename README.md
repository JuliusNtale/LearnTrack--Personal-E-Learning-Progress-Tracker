# 📚 LearnTrack – Personal E-Learning Progress Tracker

*A Student-Centric System for Tracking Self-Learning Progress*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**LearnTrack** is a minimalist, web-based application designed specifically for students to track their personal learning progress. Unlike traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS), LearnTrack empowers students to self-organize and monitor their learning goals, courses, and materials without any complexity or dependency on instructors.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Develop a student-only web platform for tracking progress in online/self-paced learning.
2. Provide tools for self-monitoring like time tracking, progress visualization, and completion rates.
3. Create a personalized hub to organize custom courses, study materials, and goals.
4. Simplify tracking with a clean UI and effective features.
5. Ensure accessibility across all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
